# Backends and the Parse Platform

## Backends

- Defined in opposition to the front-end
- The server side in a ***client-server architecture***


- What are the responsibilities of the backend?
	- authentication 
	- session management
	- business logic and DB access
	- scheduled jobs (e.g., `cron`)
	- authorization


- Deploying and implementing a traditional backend
	- machine installation!
	- operating system
	- security & firewall
	- DBMS
	- web server
	- API 
	- logging and analytics
	- backup system

We do not have time for that in this course...

**Low-code backends**
- common solutions for common backend problems
- Alternatives
	- Firebase = proprietary & hosted by Google
	- Azure = Microsoftâ€™s version 
	- **Parse Server** = open source & you can self host

## Parse Platform

Low-code backend
- Implementation language
	- Node.js based
- History
	Startup => facebook => open source
- Functionality
	- Authentication
	- File storage
	- APIS (REST & GraphQL)
	- Javascript SDK
	- Cloud functions
	- Authorization



### Using Parse from Back4App

- Where is the server?
	- on your own server
	- somewhere in the cloud; e.g., back4app 


Steps to start working with the Back4App Parse deployment 
1. Create an account on Back4App
2. Install the `parse` library from npm
3. Initialize the global Parse object (see step 4 in the [back4app guide](https://www.back4app.com/docs/react/quickstart))
 
Then you can write code like the one below to save data to your database:

```javascript
const Topic = Parse.Object.extend("Topic");
const topic = new Topic();

topic.set("name", "Backends");
topic.set("isDiscussed", false);

topic.save().then((topic) => {
	console.log("saved with id: " + topic.id);
}, (error) => {
	console.log(error.message);
})
```

To understand in the code above:
- Creating a class for the object
- `save()` - sends the data to the server
- `save.then( (obj) => {...})` - save returns a *promise*
