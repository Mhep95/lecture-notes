based on Code Reviewing

## CSS

## Name your CSS classes with kebab-case ([more on CSS naming-conventions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-naming-conventions-that-will-save-you-hours-of-debugging-35cea737d849/)) 
- this is best practice
- consistent with css property names (e.g. `background-color`)
